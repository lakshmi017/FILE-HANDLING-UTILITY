#DESCRIPTION:
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995, now owned by Oracle Corporation. It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that Java code can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets compiled Java bytecode into machine code. This "write once, run anywhere" philosophy is one of Java’s most powerful features.

Java is widely used for developing desktop applications, mobile apps (especially Android), web-based applications, enterprise software, and large systems. It is known for its simplicity, robustness, security, and scalability. Java’s syntax is similar to C++, but it removes many of the complex and error-prone features of C++, such as pointer arithmetic and multiple inheritance.

Key Features of Java:
Object-Oriented
Platform Independent
Simple and Secure
Multithreaded
Automatic Memory Management

Java Components:
JDK (Java Development Kit):
JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
